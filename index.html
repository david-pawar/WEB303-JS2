    Dr. B.R. Ambedkar endured profound experiences of untouchability, casteism, and discrimination in India. Despite these adversities, he pursued his education abroad and achieved recognition as a distinguished barrister. However, instead of choosing a prosperous life abroad, he made the remarkable decision to return to his homeland, driven by a deep commitment to social reform. Among the many decisions he made in his life, it is this selfless dedication to the betterment of society that commands my utmost respect.
